# README for GreenSolution

This project is a Next.js application initialized using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It features a simple setup to get started with Next.js along with some integrated font optimization using [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization).

## Prerequisites 
   
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:  

- Node.js 20.12.2 or later   
- A package manager like npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun   
  
## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation 
 
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adnanghaffar07/sanity-nextjs.git

Next, install the dependencies:
 
```bash

```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
